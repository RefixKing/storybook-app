The Dragon Who Couldn't Roar! Tanisha was reading under the old oak tree in their backyard when she heard the strangest soundâ€”like a kitten trying to meow through a stuffy nose. Talia looked up from her flower crown making, and little Taya dropped her collection of pretty rocks to listen. The sound was coming from behind the garden shed, and it sounded distinctly... sad. "Should we go look?" whispered Talia, always ready for an adventure but looking to her big sister for guidance. "Yes!" declared Taya, already toddling toward the sound with the fearless confidence that only the youngest sister could possess. Behind the shed, they discovered the most adorable sight: a baby dragon no bigger than their cat, with emerald scales that shimmered like jewels and tiny wings that fluttered nervously. But instead of a mighty roar, all that came out of his mouth were tiny squeaks and puffs of glittery smoke. "Oh, you poor little thing," said Tanisha, her protective big-sister instincts kicking in immediately. "What's wrong?" The dragon looked up with enormous golden eyes and managed to squeak out, "I'm Pip. I'm supposed to be learning to roar like my family, but all I can do is squeak. The other dragons are going to laugh at me when I go home." Talia, who understood what it felt like to be stuck in the middle, sat down cross-legged beside Pip. "Maybe you just need practice. We could help you!" For the next hour, the three sisters worked with Pip on his roaring technique. Tanisha showed him breathing exercises she'd learned in her school choir. Talia demonstrated different animal sounds, from lion roars to bear growls. And Taya, with her natural enthusiasm, cheered loudly for every attempt, no matter how squeaky. the world. Finally, when Pip felt confident and surrounded by friends who believed in him, he took the deepest breath of his little life and let out a roar that shook the leaves on the oak tree and sent their neighbor's cat running for cover. It wasn't the biggest roar in the world, but it was definitely a proper dragon roar. "You did it!" cheered all three sisters, and Pip's scales glowed with pride and happiness. As the sun began to set, Pip's dragon family arrived to take him home, and they were amazed to hear their little one roar with confidence. Before he left, Pip gave each sister a small scale that would always shimmer with magic, a token of their friendship and the day they helped a dragon find his voice.
