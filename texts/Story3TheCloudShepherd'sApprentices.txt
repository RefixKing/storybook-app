The Cloud Shepherd's Apprentices! On a particularly hot summer day, when even the shade felt warm and sticky, the three sisters were lying on a blanket in their backyard, trying to find shapes in the clouds. Tanisha saw a sailing ship, Talia spotted a bunny rabbit, and Taya was convinced she could see a giant ice cream cone. "I wish we could touch the clouds," sighed Talia, fanning herself with a large leaf. "I wish we could make it rain," added Tanisha, thinking of their wilting garden. "Up! Up!" declared Taya, reaching her chubby arms toward the sky. Suddenly, a shadow passed over them, but it wasn't a cloud. It was a young man floating on what appeared to be a cloud-shaped carpet, with a staff that sparkled with tiny lightning bolts. He had wind-tousled hair and clothes that seemed to be made of mist and sky. "Did someone say they wanted to touch the clouds?" he called down with a grin. The sisters sat up in amazement as the cloud shepherd—for that's clearly what he was— landed gently beside them. "I'm Nimbus," he said, "and I'm in charge of herding clouds across the sky to make sure rain falls where it's needed most. But today, some of my clouds have gotten playful and scattered in all directions. I could use some help rounding them up." "We'd love to help!" said Tanisha immediately, always ready to take on responsibility. "But how do we get up there?" asked practical Talia. Nimbus smiled and whistled a tune that sounded like wind through trees. Three small, fluffy clouds drifted down and hovered just above the ground, solid enough to sit on but soft as cotton candy. "Your cloud steeds," Nimbus announced with a bow. The sisters climbed aboard their cloud mounts, with Tanisha taking the lead on a sturdy cumulus cloud, Talia riding a graceful wispy cloud, and Taya giggling with delight on a small, bouncy cloud that seemed to match her energetic personality. They spent the afternoon learning to be cloud shepherds, using gentle whistles and hand signals to guide the scattered clouds back into formation. Tanisha proved to be a natural leader, organizing the clouds into neat rows. Talia had a gift for communicating with the shyest clouds that were hiding behind mountains. And Taya's joyful laughter seemed to make even the grumpiest storm clouds smile and cooperate. By evening, they had successfully herded all the clouds into perfect position over the drought-stricken areas that needed rain most. As a reward, Nimbus let them help create a gentle summer shower that would water all the gardens and fill the streams without causing any floods. When they returned to their backyard, Nimbus gave each sister a small cloud charm that would always bring them good weather when they needed it most. As they watched him float away on his cloud carpet, the sisters felt the first drops of the gentle rain they had helped to create, and they danced in their backyard, knowing they had helped bring relief to plants and animals across the land.
