The Sleepy Volcano's Lullaby! The sisters were visiting their grandmother in the mountains when they heard about Mount Drowsy, a small volcano that hadn't erupted in over a hundred years. Local legend said it was the sleepiest volcano in the world, but lately, it had been rumbling and grumbling, keeping the whole village awake at night. "Maybe the volcano just needs a friend," suggested Talia as they hiked up the mountain path with their grandmother. "Or maybe it's having bad dreams," added Tanisha thoughtfully. "Sleepy mountain!" said Taya, patting a large rock affectionately. When they reached the crater at the top of Mount Drowsy, they were surprised to find it wasn't filled with lava, but with the most beautiful garden they had ever seen. Flowers of every color imaginable grew in the rich volcanic soil, and in the center sat a large, friendly-looking creature that was part dragon, part mountain goat, with fur that looked like moss and eyes like warm coals. "Oh!" said the creature, looking up in surprise. "Visitors! I'm Ember, the guardian of Mount Drowsy. I'm so sorry about all the noise lately. You see, Mount Drowsy used to have the most beautiful singing voice, and every night he would sing lullabies that helped the whole valley fall asleep peacefully. But he's forgotten how to sing, and now he just grumbles and rumbles because he's frustrated." "We could help him remember," offered Tanisha. "I know lots of lullabies." "And I'm good at making up songs," added Talia. "Sing! Sing!" encouraged Taya, clapping her hands. Ember's eyes lit up with hope. "Do you really think it could work?" The sisters spent the rest of the afternoon teaching Mount Drowsy to sing again. They started with simple humming exercises, with Tanisha leading the melody, Talia adding harmony, and Taya providing enthusiastic percussion by clapping and stomping. Gradually, the mountain's rumbles began to sound more musical, and by sunset, Mount Drowsy was producing the most beautiful, deep, resonant lullabies that echoed gently through the valley. As night fell, the sisters could hear the peaceful sounds of the village settling into sleep, lulled by the mountain's gentle songs. Ember gave each of them a small volcanic glass pendant that would always help them sleep peacefully, no matter where they were. "Thank you for helping Mount Drowsy find his voice again," said Ember. "Now the whole valley can rest peacefully, and Mount Drowsy is happy because he can share his gift of music with everyone." The sisters fell asleep that night in their grandmother's cozy mountain cabin, listening to the gentle lullabies of the happiest volcano in the world, knowing they had helped bring peace and rest to an entire community.
